Program receives a string from a user with the word to be analyzed. This must include only the letters of the defined alphabet (Σ = { a-z, ␢, (, ), [, ] }).
Creates and manages a stack using a fixed sized array implementation. The pushdown automata will decide if the string is accepted or rejected using the stack data structure and the switch function available in C++.
