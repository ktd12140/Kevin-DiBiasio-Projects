Uses object-oriented programming, lists, dictionaries, and recursion to allow the user to create bank accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check the account balance, and perform transfers between accounts.
The main features are a Bank class that manages a list of account numbers and executes the methods listed above. A menu function will prompt the user to select the action they want to perform. Then, an execute_choice function will perform the operation. Finally the continue_operation function will ask the user if they want to complete more tasks. If the user selects yes, recursion is used to call the execute_choice function again.
